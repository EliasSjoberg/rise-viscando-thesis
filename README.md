# rise-viscando-thesis
This repository contains supplementary files for the MSc thesis "Generating Synthetic Scenarios to Test an AI-Enabled Traffic Measurement System". The thesis project was done in collaboration between Lund University, RISE Research Institutes of Sweden, and Viscando. The project received financial support from [SAFER](https://www.saferresearch.com/) through the pre-study CP57 - Generating Synthetic Scenarios to Test an Al-Enabled Traffic Measurement System.

The repository contains the following:
* Map files (for Roadrunner and CARLA) of a digital model of an intersection in Lindholmen, Gothenburg, Sweden.
* Trajectories for vehicles and pedestrians in the digital model.
* Source code for generation of traffic scenarios (trajectories and environmental conditions) for the digital model using search-based software testing.

## Project description
Traffic is complex! It is the sum of road design, road user behavior, and their interactions. Understanding this dynamic is central to making the transport system efficient, safe, and sustainable. Viscando offers Al-enabled data-driven solutions for traffic analysis, safety diagnostics, intelligent traffic control, naturalistic data collection, and extended perception at the very core of smart cities and autonomous driving. This is enabled by Viscando's proprietary AI- and stereovision-based infrastructure sensor OTUS3D, which is used for collection of accurate traffic movement data.

Software quality assurance (QA) must evolve as systems increasingly rely on AI. Building on initial work on simulation-based testing, we will develop evolutionary algorithms to generate test scenarios in CARLA that stress OTUS3D to its limits. As part of the project, we will develop a digital model of an intersection in Lindholmen. The project's results will support development of robust traffic measurement systems for smart city and autonomous driving applications.
